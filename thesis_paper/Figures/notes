"Figure X" refers to the figure on the paper, I tried to explain the changes for these figures with mentioning names of new figures.

-------------------------------------------------

Figure 5 : Now, I cut p-value at 0.79 for small-worldness. At p=0.79, our brain graph starts having multiple components. Please check figures "network_meas_02.eps" and "network_meas_03.eps", they are the same in principle but one of them indicates p=0.79 and S=4.45 with dashed green line.

Figure 6 : "PA_ACM_BOLD_v_3_new.eps" refers exactly the same parameters in Figure 6 but threshold is cut from p=0.34 for compatibility. p-range on figure corresponds to the following network density : 0.23 (equal and greater to) > kappa> (equal and greater to) 0.17 (this needs to be corrected on page 7). One can also have a look at "PA_ACM_BOLD_v_6_new.eps", this figure represents v=6 m/s, which is not our interest actually..

Figure 8 : "cor_BOLD_ACM_sim_no_best_new.eps" , the legends are removed. Actual simulation time is 7.5 mins but 20seconds are cut from the beginning of simulated BOLD signal (discarding transient), so it stops now at 7.17 mins

Figure 9: Both figures (left, FHN) (right, BOLD) are generated for v=3m/s. I have alsa changed c-values as it is compatible to that of Figure 6. "Random_ACM_PA_task_v_3_FHN.eps" and "Random_ACM_PA_task_v_3_BOLD.eps" are the new figures wiht v=3 now. 

Figure 10 : Histograms are chosen from "Random_ACM_PA_task_v_3_FHN.eps" now: one from the red color meaning that they are different, see "histo_r_054_v_3_c_005_fhn.eps", one from the cold color meaning that they are similar, see "histo_r_054_v_3_c_0005_fhn.eps". I have checked several histogram distributions for hot/cold colors from Figure 9 left/right, the histograms behaved always very consistent.
